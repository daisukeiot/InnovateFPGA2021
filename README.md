## IoT Solutions for InnovateFPGA design contest

This page describes how to deploy IoT solution in Azure using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.  
Microsoft provides Platform as a Service (PaaS) as well as Software as a Service (SaaS).  Depending on your needs, you may choose to deploy one of two or both.  

- [Deploy PaaS solution](PaaS-Deploy.md) : IoT Hub based sample IoT solution  
  - [Provision DE10-Nano](PaaS-Instruction.md) to the Sample IoT Solution
  - PaaS : [Technical Deep Dive](PaaS.md)

- [Deploy SaaS solution](SaaS-Deploy.md) : Azure IoT Central pre-configured application
  - [Provision DE10-Nano](SaaS-Instruction.md) to your IoT Central Application
